# Setting up Magento 2 Development Environment (without Docker) in Ubuntu 20.04

* After formatting and installing Ubuntu 20.04, just execute the script with wget

	```wget -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vpjoao98/m2-setup/master/setup.sh | bash```

* The script will install all that will be need to set up your development environment for Magento 2 in Ubuntu 20.04.

* Feel free to fork and edit this repository based on your Magento 2 development workflow.
* I have not tested if it works on other distros, so it will be by your own risk.
